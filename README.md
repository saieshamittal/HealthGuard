# HealthGuard
The HealthGuard is an innovative, machine learning-driven platform designed to revolutionize healthcare by shifting from reactive to proactive care. This system integrates real-time patient data from Fitbit devices and user-uploaded medical reports to monitor vital health metrics, detect anomalies, and predict potential health risks. By leveraging advanced ML techniques such as anomaly detection, trend forecasting, and risk prediction, the system empowers healthcare providers and patients with actionable insights, early warnings, and personalized recommendations to improve health outcomes.

This repository contains the code for a multipage web application prototype, including a user-friendly interface, data visualization tools, and an interactive chatbot for health-related queries. The system is scalable, integrates seamlessly with existing healthcare infrastructure, and prioritizes personalization and usability. In cases of sudden anomalies, the system sends immediate notifications to both the user and their designated emergency contact through an SOS button, ensuring rapid response and support.
